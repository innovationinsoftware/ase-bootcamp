### Step 1: Setting Up Azure Event Hub  
   
1. **Log in to the Azure Portal:**  
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  
   - Log in with your Azure account credentials.  
   
2. **Create a New Event Hubs Namespace:**  
   - In the Azure Portal, click on "Create a resource" and search for "Event Hubs."  
   - Click on "Event Hubs" and then click "Create."  
   - Fill in the required details:  
     - Subscription: Select your subscription.  
     - Resource Group: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.  
     - Namespace Name: Enter a unique name for your Event Hubs namespace.  
     - Location: Select the region closest to your users.  
     - Pricing Tier: Choose the appropriate pricing tier based on your needs.  
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create."  
   
3. **Create an Event Hub within the Namespace:**  
   - Once the namespace is created, navigate to it in the Azure Portal.  
   - Click on "Event Hubs" under the "Entities" section.  
   - Click "Create" to create a new Event Hub.  
   - Enter a name for your Event Hub and configure the number of partitions (e.g., 4 partitions).  
   - Click "Create."  
   
### Step 2: Creating Event Producers with Express.js  
   
1. **Install the Event Hubs SDK:**  
   - Run the following command to install the Azure Event Hubs SDK for JavaScript:  
     ```bash  
     npm install @azure/event-hubs  
     ```  
   
2. **Initialize the Event Hub Client:**  
   - Create a new Express.js application (e.g., `app.js`) and add the following code:  
     ```javascript  
     const express = require('express');  
     const { EventHubProducerClient } = require('@azure/event-hubs');  
  
     const app = express();  
     const port = 3000;  
  
     const connectionString = '<< CONNECTION STRING >>';  
     const eventHubName = '<< EVENT HUB NAME >>';  
  
     const producer = new EventHubProducerClient(connectionString, eventHubName);  
  
     app.get('/send', async (req, res) => {  
       const batch = await producer.createBatch();  
       batch.tryAdd({ body: 'First event' });  
       batch.tryAdd({ body: 'Second event' });  
  
       await producer.sendBatch(batch);  
       res.send('Events sent to Event Hub');  
     });  
  
     app.listen(port, () => {  
       console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);  
     });  
     ```  
   
3. **Run the Application:**  
   - Replace `<< CONNECTION STRING >>` and `<< EVENT HUB NAME >>` with your Event Hub's connection string and name.  
   - Run the application using the following command:  
     ```bash  
     node app.js  
     ```  
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/send` to send events to your Event Hub.  
   
### Step 3: Creating Event Consumers with Express.js  
   
1. **Initialize the Event Hub Consumer Client:**  
   - Create a new Express.js application (e.g., `consumer.js`) and add the following code:  
     ```javascript  
     const express = require('express');  
     const { EventHubConsumerClient } = require('@azure/event-hubs');  
  
     const app = express();  
     const port = 3001;  
  
     const connectionString = '<< CONNECTION STRING >>';  
     const eventHubName = '<< EVENT HUB NAME >>';  
     const consumerGroup = '$Default';  
  
     const consumer = new EventHubConsumerClient(consumerGroup, connectionString, eventHubName);  
  
     app.get('/receive', async (req, res) => {  
       const subscription = consumer.subscribe({  
         processEvents: async (events, context) => {  
           for (const event of events) {  
             console.log(`Received event: ${event.body}`);  
           }  
         },  
         processError: async (err, context) => {  
           console.error(`Error: ${err}`);  
         }  
       });  
  
       res.send('Receiving events from Event Hub');  
     });  
  
     app.listen(port, () => {  
       console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}/`);  
     });  
     ```  
   
2. **Run the Application:**  
   - Replace `<< CONNECTION STRING >>` and `<< EVENT HUB NAME >>` with your Event Hub's connection string and name.  
   - Run the application using the following command:  
     ```bash  
     node consumer.js  
     ```  
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001/receive` to start receiving events from your Event Hub.  
   - Send several events using `http://localhost:3000/send` you should get the following error message in the consumer terminal window:
   ```
   Error: MessagingError: Error 0: MessagingError: At least one receiver for the endpoint is created with epoch of '0', and so non-epoch receiver is not allowed. Either reconnect with a higher epoch, or make sure all epoch receivers are closed or disconnected. 
   ````
   - Identify the source of the problem and attemp to resolve it.
   
### Step 4: Configuring Partitions  
   
1. **Specify the Number of Partitions:**  
   - When creating your Event Hub, specify the number of partitions based on your expected data volume and processing needs. For example, you can start with 4 partitions.  
   
2. **Configure Partition Keys for Event Producers:**  
   - Modify your event producer script to include partition keys. This ensures that related events are sent to the same partition.  
     ```javascript  
     const batch = await producer.createBatch();  
     batch.tryAdd({ body: 'First event', partitionKey: 'device1' });  
     batch.tryAdd({ body: 'Second event', partitionKey: 'device2' });  
     ```  
   
### Step 5: Scaling Event Hubs  
   
1. **Horizontal Scaling:**  
   - Add more partitions to distribute the load across multiple consumers. You can do this by updating the number of partitions in the Event Hub settings.  
   
2. **Vertical Scaling:**  
   - Increase the capacity of existing partitions by adjusting the number of throughput units (TUs) in the Event Hub settings.  
   
3. **Scaling Using Azure CLI:**  
   - Use the following Azure CLI commands to scale your Event Hub:  
     ```bash  
     # Scale the number of partitions  
     az eventhubs eventhub update --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --namespace-name <NamespaceName> --name <EventHubName> --partition-count <NewPartitionCount>  
  
     # Scale the number of throughput units  
     az eventhubs namespace update --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --name <NamespaceName> --sku <SkuName> --capacity <NewCapacity>  
     ```  
   
### Step 6: Monitoring and Diagnostics  
   
1. **Set Up Monitoring:**  
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Event Hubs namespace.  
   - Click on "Metrics" under the "Monitoring" section.  
   - Add metrics such as incoming requests, outgoing requests, and errors to monitor the performance of your Event Hub.  
   
2. **Set Up Alerts:**  
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Event Hubs namespace.  
   - Click on "Alerts" under the "Monitoring" section.  
   - Create alerts for critical metrics to notify you of potential issues.  
   
### Step 7: Handling Backpressure  
   
1. **Buffering:**  
   - Implement buffering in your event producer script to temporarily store incoming data until the system can process it.  
     ```javascript  
     const buffer = [];  
     const maxBufferSize = 100;  
  
     app.get('/send', async (req, res) => {  
       buffer.push({ body: 'New event' });  
  
       if (buffer.length >= maxBufferSize) {  
         const batch = await producer.createBatch();  
         buffer.forEach(event => batch.tryAdd(event));  
         await producer.sendBatch(batch);  
         buffer.length = 0; // Clear the buffer  
       }  
  
       res.send('Event added to buffer');  
     });  
     ```  
   
2. **Throttling:**  
   - Control the rate of data ingestion by adding delays in your event producer script.  
     ```javascript  
     const delay = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));  
  
     app.get('/send', async (req, res) => {  
       const batch = await producer.createBatch();  
       batch.tryAdd({ body: 'First event' });  
       batch.tryAdd({ body: 'Second event' });  
  
       await producer.sendBatch(batch);  
       await delay(1000); // Add a delay of 1 second  
  
       res.send('Events sent to Event Hub');  
     });  
     ```  
   
3. **Scaling:**  
   - Scale your infrastructure by adding more partitions or increasing the number of throughput units (TUs).  
   
### Step 8: Best Practices for High-Throughput Management  
   
1. **Partitioning:**  
   - Ensure proper partitioning to enable parallel processing and improve performance.  
   
2. **Scaling:**  
   - Implement effective scaling strategies to maintain system capacity and handle increasing data volumes.  
   
3. **Monitoring:**  
   - Regularly monitor and diagnose your Event Hubs to identify potential issues and maintain performance.  
   
4. **Backpressure Handling:**  
   - Implement strategies such as buffering, throttling, and scaling to handle backpressure and maintain system stability.  
   
By following these steps, you will gain practical experience in managing high-throughput event streams with Azure Event Hubs using Express.js. This exercise covers key concepts such as partitioning, scaling, monitoring, and handling backpressure, providing you with the knowledge and skills to effectively manage high-throughput data streams.
